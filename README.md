## Overview

This repository contains SQL projects that provide insights into various datasets, utilizing SQL queries and Tableau visualizations. The primary goal is to demonstrate SQL's power in data analysis and visualization by answering complex business questions and generating reports that are insightful and actionable.

The SQL queries used in these projects are intended for use with Tableau and other BI tools for deeper data exploration.

## Project List

### 1. **Movies Dataset**
This project uses a dataset of movies, including information such as movie names, genres, release years, ratings, and budgets. The objective is to use SQL queries to analyze trends in the movie industry, such as:

- The highest-rated movies.
- The relationship between budget and revenue.
- The most popular genres.

**Files**: 
- `movies.csv`: Dataset containing movie-related data.
- SQL Queries: A collection of queries to analyze the dataset.
  
### 2. **Covid-19 Analysis**
This project focuses on COVID-19 data analysis. Using SQL queries, we explore COVID-19 case numbers, death rates, and vaccination rates, offering insights into pandemic trends across different regions and countries.

**Files**:
- `CovidDeaths.csv`: Dataset with COVID-19 case and death data.
- SQL Queries: Various queries that analyze the dataset, from basic statistics to more advanced trends.
